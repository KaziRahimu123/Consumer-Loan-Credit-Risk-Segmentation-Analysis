# Business Problem
The core business problem is how to grow consumer lending profitably without increasing default risk by using application data to target and approve the right customers with the right offers. The lender needs to identify which demographic and income segments show strong job stability for standard loans, match housing situation and dependent burden to the correct product (unsecured vs. longer-term home-related loans), design pricing and credit limits that balance income and employment tenure (including gender patterns in the data), and isolate “premium” profiles that combine higher income with low household burden for low-risk, high-value credit products.
The core business problem is broken down into four segments-

1️⃣ Which demographic and income-type segments show the most stable employment among working-age applicants, and should therefore be prioritized for standard personal loan products?

2️⃣ How does the housing situation relate to income and family burden, and which housing segments should be prioritized for unsecured personal loans vs. longer-term mortgage or home-improvement products?

3️⃣ Are there meaningful differences between male and female applicants in income and employment characteristics that could influence how loan products are priced or marketed?

4️⃣ Which applicant profiles combine higher income with lower dependent burden, making them strong candidates for a “premium” credit card or low-risk personal loan offer?
