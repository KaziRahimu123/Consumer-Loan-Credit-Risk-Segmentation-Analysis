# Description
This project analyzes loan and credit application data to identify high-quality, low-risk customer segments for consumer lending. Using income, employment stability, demographics, and household burden, it delivers data-driven insights to improve loan approvals, pricing strategies, and targeted marketing without increasing portfolio risk.

# Key Findings
The strongest, lowest-risk growth opportunity comes from balancing income and stability rather than prioritizing a single factor.
